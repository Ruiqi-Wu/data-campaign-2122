a robust model to identify symmetry properties for all entries, includes point-, factor-, space groups, site symmetries and Wyckoff positions. It determines a system-specific mapping tolerance that yields symmetry operations entirely commensurate with fundamental crystallographic principles[1].

An autonomous thermodynamic stability analysis model has the function of identifying stable or coexist phases, equivalent structures, robust stability and decomposition reactions [2].

CCE is a method developed to solve the inaccurate formation enthalpies prediction made by the density functional theory [3]

 ### Description:
Automatic flow (Aflow) is a DFT and API database managed by Duke University and is designed for material analysis. It contains 3.4 million types of materials’ information  regarding crystal energy bands, thermal and mechanical properties and so on. Two types of material structures are present in the database: experimental data from databases such as the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD), the other are fictional structures, called structure prototypes. The properties of the structures are generated through quantum mechanics algorithms, the results are stored in the database for material choosing and training of machine learning models. Aflow offers the high-throughput calculation of alloys, intermetallics and inorganic compounds, as well as manipulation tools available for online operation[4].  User-defined material screening and automatic quantum mechanics calculations have made the database crucial in computational material discovery[5].
