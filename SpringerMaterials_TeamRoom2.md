* Size of the database: 

The database is a comprehensive resource of curated data covering 3,000 properties and 290,000 materials on one platform.
 
* If you use the data from this platform, how are you going to cite it? Is there a requirement on the cite?

Citations for SpringerMaterials content can be easily exported in multiple standard formats.


* what is the licence of the platform it self? of the data on it?

Access to Springer Nature content can be available through a Springer Nature license. A Springer Nature licence is available to academic institutions, governments and corporations and is purchased by everyone from small colleges on a single site to global organizations with multiple locations. Tailored licensing options are based on the population served and its research intensity.  Continue reading to explore the options best suited for your organization and it's patrons.
